You're stuck in my head, stuck in my heart, stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you
This is the part, you've gotta say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, leaving tonight while everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you
Oh, baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh, baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go
Run away with me, run away with me
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold
Run away with me, run away with me
We could turn the world to gold
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold
Oh, my baby, take me to the feeling
Take me to, take me to it
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Just run away
Run away with me
With me
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Be tormented by me babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cool and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion 
I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah
Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby
Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch!)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
(Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
