You're stuck in my head, stuck in my heart, stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here, I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you
This is the part, you've gotta say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, leaving tonight while everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
I wanna be there with you
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you
Oh, baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Oh, baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go
Run away with me, run away with me
Over the weekend
We could turn the world to gold
Run away with me, run away with me
We could turn the world to gold
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold
Oh, my baby, take me to the feeling
Take me to, take me to it
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Just run away
Run away with me
With me
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Run away with me
Be tormented by me babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cool and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion 
I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah
Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby
Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch!)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
(Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
Worlds fly by
Drove by your place and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
But I still think about you, think about you
And I can't lie
I like the feeling, how you make me shy
I share my secrets and I will not hide
I know that one could be two, one could be two
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
Cause I want what I want, but with you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Eyes so bright
You got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn but still I can't sleep right
I should've asked you to stay, begged you to stay
Why when I get right next to you
I hear this heartbeat breaking through?
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
Cause I want what I want, but with you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

Wanna feel like this forever
It's the way we are together
And I never thought I'd ever
Say forever

I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best of you and more

Just show me that you care
You and me, we've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down, know what you need to get you high
Top down, like the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside, all of your fears, leave them behind
Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
Eyes wide, like you've never seen the ocean never seen the tides
No hope, now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off, got your hands in the air and you're feeling alright
Gold vines, glistening on my skin for you
Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
Baby take my hand now, don't you cry
I won't let you sleep, I won't let you hide
No more tears, don't waste another day
Go on and fight, don't lay down to die
Come on get up, you'll make it through okay
Come on get up, don't waste another day
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you), I love you while
Making the most of the night
I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine
But I still love you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me
When I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Why won't you come around
To the spot that we met
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I'm just a flicker in your head
But I still love you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me
When I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Why won't you come around
To the spot that we met
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I'll make time for you (time for you-ooh)
I'll make time for you (time for you-ooh)
I love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I'll make time for you (time for you-ooh)
I'll make time for you (time for you-ooh)
I'll make time for you (time for you-ooh)
I'll make time for you (time for you-ooh)
I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to
Up and run when someone said they needed me
But you
You could be the one
You could be the one
Baby let's go get lost
I like that you're drivin' slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
I was always shy and careful
I was sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently
But you
You could be the one
You could be the one
Baby let's go get lost
I like that you're drivin' slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
Let's get lost (let's get lost)
You wanna get lost? (you wanna get lost?)
Let's get lost (let's get lost)
I wanna get lost
Baby let's go get lost
I like that you're drivin' slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
